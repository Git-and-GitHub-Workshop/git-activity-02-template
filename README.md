# Git Activity

This is a template repo for the 2nd Git activity in Module 1 of the Git and GitHub Workshop.

This activity will be used along with the quiz in Canvas. The quiz will ask you questions about the repository, which you can only answer using the repo.

This activity will also mirror, in some ways, the slides from Dr. Silva's video recording. In that recording, she explored the idea of snapshots using an example pictured below.

Remember, this repo started with a README.md file--maybe this very file you are reading now!

Then, a folder called "Animal_functionality" and a Python script called "Animal.py" were added. Since we don't want to work with Python code in this exercise, we are changing things up a bit, and the new file will be a Markdown file called "Animal.md".

Also, note that the commit history and the resulting snapshots will differ from the simplified example from the video.

## Instructions

You should already have the Canvas quiz accompanying this exercise opened; if not, open it now.

1. The first step was using GitHub Classroom to accept this assignment. Done!
