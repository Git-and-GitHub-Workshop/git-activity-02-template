# Git Activity

Now that you have accepted the assignment, you have your own copy of this repository to work in while completing [Module 1, Activity 2 of the Introduction to Git and GitHub course](https://ufl.instructure.com/courses/495921/pages/git-activity-2-branching-and-merging).


The files and actions in activity mirror, in some ways, the slides from Dr. Silva's video recording. In that recording, she explored the idea of snapshots using an example pictured below.

Remember, her repo started with a README.md file--maybe this very file you are reading now!

Then, a folder called "Animal_functionality" and a Python script called "Animal.py" were added. Since we don't want to work with Python code in this exercise, we are changing things up a bit, and the new file will be a Markdown file called "Animal.md".

Also, note that the commit history and the resulting snapshots will differ from the simplified example from the video.
